# TRUVEL
A Cross-platform True Travelling Application for two different types of travellers(travellers with vehicle and without vehicle)

The Source Code for this project has been kept confidential.

Problem:
Many civilians are using public or commercial transport and many are using personal vehicles; by doing so, civilians with their personal vehicles are spending a lot on fuel and civilians travelling with public or commercial transport are also paying a lot and wasting time as well in waiting for the transport, thus, a cross-platform was required for these two types of civilians to bridge them with a platform that allows both to travel together at a most relevant common path.

Our Proposed Solution:
A cross-platform application for civilians who travel with their own vehicle and for civilians who pay a lot to travel hours in commercial transport. The application benefits civilians by reducing the fuel cost for a person with a vehicle and allows cheap travel transport for a person without a vehicle.

Uniqueness:
Our Product: Truvel bridges not only people with and without vehicles but also Adharcard-Verified people without vehicles; such that, even women can feel safe to use our greatly optimised application to connect with more women and travel along irrespective of what time it is; in short, our product takes security seriously.

The key benefits of Truvel are:
1. Bridges people with and without vehicles according to their needs.
2. Reduces the travelling cost at an exponential rate.
3. Adds up to a great level of security for the authenticity of any person via Adharcard-verification.
4. Connects people without vehicles for safer travel.
5. Travellers can Bargain on the cost and time for the journey in advance.
6. Truvel shows the most relevant result to the inputs given by the Travellers.
